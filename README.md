### Overview
Used JavaScript to make a short multiple choice quiz with various screens and various interactive elements.  

### Explanation of task
This project uses JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS documents to present a short interactive quiz based on pop culture moveis and TV shows.  One feature of this project is that it utilizes local storage to retain player names and scores at the end of the game.  These names and scores can then be refered back to at a later time.  This quiz features questions and multiple choice answers.  There is a timer that counts down and subtracts time for incorrect answers.  

### Benefit of quiz
This is a short project that is meant for limited fun. This project was built more for the purpose of refining skills and gaining knowledge and experience.  

### Personal benefit from making quiz
This quiz taught me a great deal about how to use JavaScript to manipluate classes and attributes for various HTML and CSS elements.  This project taught me how to incorporate multiple files of the same type into the same project.  I learned a great deal about how to access and manipulate local storage which is sure to come in very useful again in the future.  I hope that as my knowlede level grows that I can continue to make this quiz ever more enticing and fully developed.  This project contains many useful tools that I will probably refer back to in the future.
